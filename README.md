# About DGI-Corpus Dataset
Thank you for visiting!

This is the multi-hazard Chinese instruction fine-tuning dataset constructed in our paper, "Research on Chinese Disaster Geospatial Intelligence Extraction Assisted by Fine-Tuning Large Language Models."

Our data is currently being prepared. Once the manuscript is accepted and the data is de-identified, it will be uploaded to this repository. Please stay tuned for updates.

## Introduction

This is the public repository for the DGI-Corpus dataset associated with the manuscript titled "Fine-tuning Large Language Models to Assist in the Extraction of Chinese Disaster Geographical Spatial Information." Our aim is to promote research and development in this field by publishing disaster corpora available in the Chinese domain.

## Using the Dataset

If you intend to use this dataset, please **cite the source** to help us better understand the progress in the field research. We are grateful for your cooperation!

## Dataset Status

Our data is currently being prepared. Once the manuscript is accepted and the data is de-identified, it will be uploaded to this repository. Please stay tuned for updates.
